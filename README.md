Markdown resume provides a simple, elegant, and fast workflow to write resumes and CVs.

- Tired of formatting resumes in word documents? Try writing resumes in Markdown, converting it to html, then print to pdf.
- Applying to many jobs, and targeted resumes are hard to version control? Try writing resumes in Markdown and version control with Git.

## Prerequisite

1. Download [VS Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extension in VS Studio Code

## Workflow

The workflow is quite simple:

1. Have `resume.md` and `resume.css` in one directory.
2. Open `resume.md` in VS Studio Code.
3. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Command+Shift+P) and search and use the command "Markdown All in One: Print current document to HTML".
   1. An html file will be generated in the directory
4. Open the html file in a browser.
5. Use the browser's print functionality to "print to pdf" (typically Ctrl+P or Command+P).
   1. The resume pdf can be saved to desired destination

Here are demos of the workflow in Windows and macOS:

- Section heading should have second level heading
  - `## Work Experience`
  - Colored, medium font, border bottom
- Individual experience should have third level heading
  - `### Student Assistant`
  - Bolded, small font
- Duration of experience should be wrapped by tag `time` and in the same line as third level heading
  - `### Student Assistant <time> 2020 - 2021 </time>`
  - Right-aligned, bolded, small font
- Location of experience should be wrapped by tag `location`
  - `<location> Boston, MA </location>`
  - Italicized, small font
- Description can be listed using Markdown style list
  - `- Designed 3 websites with cool graphics.`

### [`resume.css`](source/resume.css)

[`resume.css`](source/resume.css) controls resume's styling. Change it if you want to customize the template! Below are some tips:

- Colored texts are `h2` and `a` tags with color `#0D47A1`.
- To tighten the list spacing to fit content in one page, try decreasing the `li` tag's default line height of 150%.
  - Tweaking page margin in browser print option is also helpful.
