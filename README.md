The workflow is quite simple:

  > **Warning**
  > - You should wait until the HTML page is completely loaded on your browser.
  > - If the skills colored background doesn't appear in the preview of the print dialog, when you save the HTML to PDF, you SHOULD check "Print backgrounds" checkbox in "Options" section in Chrome print dialog (or the equivalent option in your browser).

### [`resume.css`](source/resume.css)

[`resume.css`](source/resume.css) controls resume's styling. Change it if you want to customize the template! Below are some tips:

- Colored texts are `h2` and `a` tags with color `#0D47A1`.
- To tighten the list spacing to fit content in one page, try decreasing the `li` tag's default line height of 150%.
  - Tweaking page margin in browser print option is also helpful.
